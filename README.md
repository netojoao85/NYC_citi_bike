### A Report to provide business intelligence
 
Created a report to provide Business Intelligence, using *nyc_bikes* dataset from the *tsibbledata* package. You can find more about the dataset [here](https://rdrr.io/github/tidyverts/tsibbledata/man/nyc_bikes.html).

To provide actionable insights to the business and how it relates to key performance indicators, each visualisation has a description and interpretation to explain the context and insights. The reports consider the pattern of bike hires over time, as well as bike hire patterns between bike rider demographics.
